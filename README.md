# Natours Project

**Warning:** This code was already published in one of my previous repositories. I wanted to singlehandedly publish this, now it will be deployed.

This is the first project from the Udemy course of Jonas Schmedtmann. I will use `create-react-app` in order to keep the project relevant â€” the original version is just vanilla CSS .

- On the topside of the page, I intentionally didn't put exaggerated animations.

- Did not use 7-1 CSS Architecture, used styling files in the same folder of the components instead.

**Note:** It's no perfect, I made changes on my own, and not all the code and visuals are the same. Also, there are some parts that need to be corrected, however, I didn't need to change anything.
